# Gesture-Volume-and-Lighting-Control
Handtracking using Mediapipe and OpenCV to control both your computer brightness and volume. 

I will be combining some aspects of other OpenCV and Mediapipe projects I have been working on.

The goal is to have the Left Hand control the computers brightness and have the Right Hand control the volume. 

I have already made two projects that track finger movement. The first one I made would track your pointer finger pressing space
evertime you lower your finger. This project worked really well and I was able to play simple games like Flappy Bird without using my keyboard. 

The second project I made calculated the movement of your pointer finger and would allow you to use your pointer finger to virtually move your mouse. 

Lastly, I have also made a program that can decipher your left hand from your right hand. 

I hope that I can combine what I've learned from these smaller projects to create this one and excel my knowledge in computer vision and AI.
